Here's an example of a table:

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| ---------| ---------|
| Content 1| Content 2|
| Content 3| Content 4|

Now, let's add a list:

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2
- Item 3

Feel free to modify this Markdown file to suit your needs and experiment with Tailwind CSS classes.

> Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes styling your projects easy and efficient. It provides a wide range of pre-designed classes that you can apply directly to your HTML elements, allowing for rapid development without the need for custom CSS.
